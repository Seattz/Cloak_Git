Title: Cloak

Concept: Cloak is a timed maze runner where you follow a mysterious protagonist named Cloak, making his way through massive stone labyrinths in an attempt to collect magical Rune Stones. Once he collects all the runes within a maze he is magically teleported to another sect of the labyrinth to repeat. If he cannot collect each rune in time, however, it can only be assumed he will be trapped within the labyrinth, until he finds another way out. Once he completes the labyrinth, he will be granted a wish. 

Gameplay and mechanics: Cloak is a timed maze runner, where you have 10 seconds to traverse a small maze and pick up three runes. Once each rune is picked up, a magical particle effect plays along with a lovely chime. In the top right is a timer. Whether you win or lose, the timer is stopped. If you lose IE, if you do not collect each rumes in 10 seconds, you also cannot pick up the runes. When you spawn in initially, you cannot move for 2 seconds. The timer does not run at this time, and this is to explain the rules.

Basic requirements: Cloak meets every basic requirement of the game, being a 10 second timed game with a win/loss scenario, a 2 second announcement which does not effect time, playable with keyboard, single player with text, a clear endgame, and is NOT a clone of a basic unity project.

Audio requirements: Cloak meets every audio requirement, having background music, a sound during the 2 second announcement, a pick up sound when you collect a rune, and individual win/loss music.

Visual: Rune meets every visual requirement, with a background, a self created player sprite, a text UI for time and score, and a custom particle effect.
